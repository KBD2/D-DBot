# D-DBot
My D&amp;D Bot's source code
This is a Discord bot written in Python that provides utilities such as a virtual D&D dice and commands to get info on D&D via an API. 
It's my first bot, so the code's definitely not amazing and it has many flaws, but I'm still proud.
-Designed to be used on one or two smallish servers
-Run in Python 3.5
